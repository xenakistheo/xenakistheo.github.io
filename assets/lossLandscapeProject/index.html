						<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            It is widely accepted that overparameterization plays a central role in the remarkable generalization capabilities of modern deep neural networks. Specifically, increasing model capacity leads to
loss landscapes characterized by numerous flat valleys or basins, each corresponding to similarly
low loss. A central feature of these landscapes is <strong>mode connectivity</strong>: the phenomenon in which
a path of low loss exists between two distinct, well-trained solutions (modes) of the network.
Rather than being isolated points, these minima are linked, making it possible to traverse the
loss landscape along a smooth path without encountering significant barriers in loss.
<br><br>
Most existing research has focused on the general existence of such low-loss paths. However,
less attention has been paid to the detailed geometric properties, such as sharpness or curvature
of these paths and how they evolve quantitatively with the degree of overparameterization. A
quantitative analysis of this geometric evolution is crucial for identifying key factors that govern
the loss landscape and generalization performance. This understanding can be instrumental to
advancing both the theoretical understanding of deep learning and the practical design of more
efficient and robust neural networks. The fundamental nature of this topic makes it broadly
applicable across a wide range of deep learning architectures and tasks.

						<h2>1.1 Novelty and Significance</h2>
  This project aims to help bridge the gap between properties of the optimization landscape and the
practical performance of deep learning models. This will be done by performing a comprehensive
geometric analysis of the loss landscape for multiple deep neural networks. The <strong>novelty</strong> of our
work comes from the quantitative investigation of barrier height, path curvature, and sharpness
as a function of a single, controlled factor: network depth, a proxy for overparameterization. The
results aim to provide intuitive and meaningful insights into how overparameterization influences
the landscape and performance of deep learning models. The <strong>significance</strong> of these results is that
they offer a clearer link between loss landscape geometry and empirical performance, enabling
more principled design and training strategies of deep learning models.

						<h2>1.2 Hypotheses</h2>
            The hypotheses for our work include:
			<ul>
				<li> <b> Lower Barrier Heights Accompany Deeper Networks</b> <br>Increased network depth will lead to lower barrier heights (smaller maximum change in accuracy along the path) between connected minima. This suggests that the loss landscape becomes smoother and more connected as overparameterization increases.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Path Curvature Decreases with Overparameterization</b> <br>The curvature of the low-loss paths connecting distinct solutions will decrease as network depth increases, indicating that the mode connectivity approaches a linear relationship.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Increased Overparameterization Correlates with Flatter Minima</b> <br>As the network's depth increases, the local minima found by the optimizer will become flatter. Flatter minima are generally associated with better generalization.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Path Geometry Directly Predicts Generalization</b> <br>A measurable correlation will exist between the geometric properties (low barrier height, low curvature, low sharpness) of the low-loss paths and the final test accuracy of the models, thereby providing a useful predictor for generalization performance beyond training loss alone.</li>

						<h3>2. Background</h3>
					  Empirical and theoretical studies have demonstrated that wider networks tend to exhibit mode connectivity: where distinct minima are connected by a smooth, low-loss path <a href="#ref_1">[1, 2]</a>. These networks tend to occupy regions of the loss landscape that are smoother, with shorter and less pronounced barriers between minima. This characteristic suggests that wider models, by virtue of their increased parameterization, might allow for greater flexibility in optimization, potentially leading to more robust solutions.<br><br>

            However, most prior work has focused on the existence of connectivity, rather than the <em>geometry</em> of these connections. In particular, even fewer studies have measured how landscape properties, such as barrier height and path sharpness, vary not just within one path, but across varying architectural factors like depth in practical deep learning settings on real datasets (e.g., ResNet or CNNs on CIFAR-10).<br><br>

            Moreover, while increased connectivity through overparameterization has been linked to improved generalization, this relationship is not without limits <a href="#ref_3">[3, 4]</a>. Beyond a certain degree of overparameterization, increased capacity may no longer improve generalization. Larger models might exhibit wider but shallower basins in the loss landscape, potentially impairing test performance on out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, increasing depth and width might give opposing results <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>. The precise conditions under which the benefits of increased connectivity plateau, and how the loss landscape geometry contributes to this effect, remains underexplored.<br><br>

            The collective body of existing research confirms the central role of overparameterization in shaping the loss landscape <a href="#ref_6">[6, 7]</a>. It has been established that the set of optimal solutions in networks where the number of parameters significantly exceeds the number of data points is not discrete but rather forms a high-dimensional submanifold <a href="#ref_8">[8, 9]</a>. Awareness of this phenomenon fundamentally changes the optimization challenge. Finding a good solution requires finding not only low-loss minimum, but also a minimum that generalizes well, a property not reflected in the loss itself. This has motivated work to study the effect of hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size on the width of the minima that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges to <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a>. Furthermore, dedicated flatness-aware optimization strategies, such as sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) <a href="#ref_11">[11]</a> and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) <a href="#ref_12">[12]</a>, have been developed to actively seek out flat minima <a href="#ref_13">[13]</a>.<br><br>

            Furthermore, a substantial area of research has focused on the relationship between optimization and flat minima, hypothesizing that the flatness of a basin correlates directly with a model's superior generalization ability <a href="#ref_14">[14]</a>. However, the connection between these macroscopic landscape properties, like the existence of flat minima, and the microscopic geometry of the connections between them, like path curvature and sharpness, remains loosely quantified, particularly in the context of controlled architectural variations like depth on modern architectures <a href="#ref_6">[6, 7]</a>.<br><br>

			Thus, a significant gap remains in rigorously and empirically linking the degree of overparameterization to the quantitative geometry of the optimization landscape. This motivates a systematic investigation of how overparameterization shapes the geometry of the loss landscape, and how this, in turn, influences key properties like generalization. By studying these aspects in a controlled and thorough manner, we aim to uncover insights that could inform the design of more efficient architectures and optimization strategies, ultimately leading to more reliable and interpretable models.

						<h3>3. Methods & Experiments</h3>
			Before introducing the specific metrics, we briefly summarize the overall 
			methodology used to
			generate the objects we evaluated.<br><br>
            For each network architecture, we trained two independent 
			models from different random initializations. 
			Each training run produced a set of parameters, 
			denoted A and B, which corresponded to distinct 
			minima of the loss landscape. Using these two solutions 
			as endpoints, we then constructed a low-loss connecting 
			curve in parameter space by introducing and optimizing a 
			third point, C, which defined a nonlinear interpolation 
			between A and B.<br><br>

            This resulted in a parameterized path passing through (A, C, B), 
			along which we sampled and evaluated loss, curvature, and sharpness.
			For comparison, we also evaluated the straight-line interpolation 
			between A and B, as well as geometric properties of the plane spanned 
			by the three points.

			<br><br> The path was parametrized using established interpolation 
			schemes: <strong>Bezier curve</strong>, and <strong>piecewise linear (PolyChain)</strong>. 
			In addition, we computed 
			the loss on a grid of points across this plane in order
			to visualize local variations in loss away from the optimized path.<br><br>

            Along each path we evaluated: training and test loss, curvature metrics, maximum barrier height, and 
			generalization gap. This procedure allowed us to compare different architectures 
			not only in terms of whether a low-loss path existed, but also the geometry of it.

						<h2>3.1 Network Architecture</h2>
            To investigate how mode connectivity and loss-landscape geometry varies as a function of 
			architectural complexity, we compared several variants of the same neural network family. 
			Specifically, we evaluated five residual networks of increasing depth: ResNet-8, ResNet-26, 
			ResNet-38, ResNet-65, and ResNet-119.<br><br>

            Residual networks (ResNets) introduce skip connections that allow information to bypass nonlinear layers, enabling efficient optimization of deep architectures and mitigating vanishing gradients <a href="#ref_15">[15]</a>. Beyond their practical advantages, ResNets serve as a useful test case for loss-landscape analysis. Their residual block structure with skip connections and ease of scalability leads to loss landscapes with nontrivial geometry <a href="#ref_9">[9, 16]</a>, while still being compact enough to train extensively under controlled conditions <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. 
			 We restrict our study to a
single architectural family rather than comparing radically different model types for two reasons:<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Varying depth within the same architecture allows us to isolate the effect of overparameterization without confounding differences in inductive biases or other factors.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Exploring mode connectivity requires repeated training, interpolation, and evaluation across
networks, which scales unfavorably with architecture complexity. Restricting to a single
family keeps the computational cost feasible.</li>
			</ul>
			We chose ResNets in particular because they were covered in our course and are known to
outperform "plain" CNNs on image recognition tasks <a href="#ref_15">[15]</a>.
			By spanning more than an order of magnitude in model size, this architectural sweep allowed us to examine how path geometry, barrier height, and generalization evolve as networks transition from moderately to heavily overparameterized regimes.<br><br>
			The number of parameters in the chosen models can be seen in the table below.<br><br>

						<h2>3.2 Datasets</h2>
            We conducted experiments on two widely used image-classification benchmarks: CIFAR-10 and 
			CIFAR-100. Each dataset consists of 60,000 RGB images of size 32×32, split into 50,000 
			training and 10,000 test images, covering everyday object categories.<br><br>

            The two datasets differ primarily in granularity: CIFAR-10 has 10 classes with 6,000 images per class, 
			while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes with 600 images per class. CIFAR-100 poses a more challenging classification 
			problem due to the fact that it has fewer images per category. This typically results in lower test accuracy, and will potentially also affect the loss landscape.

						<h2>3.4 Training Configuration</h2>
            All networks were trained from scratch using identical optimization settings to maintain a consistent baseline across architectures. Minimal effort was devoted to hyperparameter tuning to
avoid introducing biases toward any particular model.<br><br>
Each model was trained for 80 epochs using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (0.9),
an initial learning rate of 0.1, and weight decay of 3×10<sup>-4</sup> <br><br>
A piecewise learning rate schedule
was applied in which the learning rate remained constant during the first half of training and
decayed linearly during the subsequent 40% of epochs. Standard data augmentation was used in
the form of random cropping and horizontal flipping, and the batch size was kept constant across
architectures. No architecture-specific regularization or optimization heuristics were employed
beyond weight decay and the learning rate schedule

						<h2>3.6 Metrics</h2>
			To evaluate how network architecture influences the geometry of low-loss paths, we quantify
several landscape properties that reflect smoothness, curvature, and robustness. While many
potential metrics exist, we focus on three measures that capture complementary geometric characteristics: barrier height, angle-based curvature, and sharpness. Together, these metrics provide
insight into how easily solutions can be connected, how much deviation from linearity is required,
and how locally stable the solutions are along the path.


						<h2>3.6.1 Barrier Height</h2>
			Given a parameterized path between two independently trained models, sampled at N points,
we define the barrier height as the difference between the maximum and minimum accuracy observed
along the path. Intuitively, this measures the “cost” of traveling between two minima: a high
barrier implies that the path crosses a region of poor performance, while a nearly flat barrier
indicates a smooth and well-connected landscape. We compute barrier height for two different
interpolation regimes: the computed low-loss path (Bezier and PolyChain), and the straight-line
interpolation between the two endpoints. Barrier height can be evaluated on the training accuracy,
test accuracy, or the generalization gap. From the sampled accuracy along the path we also compute the 
Area Under the Curve (AUC), which captures the total loss accumulated along the path. 
Instead of integrating over the entire interpolation range, we restrict the calculation to 
the segment between the points where accuracy reaches its minimum and maximum values. This 
helps distinguish models that share the same barrier height but differ in how much of the path 
exhibits elevated loss.


				<h3>3.6.2 Angle</h3>
The curve-based interpolation methods that were used (Bezier curves or PolyChains) introduce a middle
point that is optimized to minimize loss along the path. The relative position of this middle point
provides a proxy for how “curved” the low-loss path must be in order to connect the two solutions.
Conceptually, if the middle point lies close to the straight segment connecting the endpoints, the
landscape is close to linearly connected. Conversely, if the middle point lies far from the segment,
the optimization process had to search farther from a linear trajectory to avoid high-loss regions,
suggesting a higher degree of curvature or ruggedness in the landscape. To quantify this, we treat
the three points (the two minima and the optimized middle point) as a triangle in parameter
space, and compute the angles of the triangle, and the area of the triangle given that the distance
between endpoints is fixed.

				<h2>3.6.3 Sharpness</h2>
While barrier height and curvature reflect global properties of the path, we also desire to characterize 
the local geometry of the landscape around the low-loss solutions. Specifically, we are
interested in whether the path corresponds to flat, stable basins or sharp, narrow valleys. Flat
regions are typically associated with improved generalization, robustness, and lower sensitivity
to perturbations. A natural way to quantify local geometry is through the Hessian matrix, which
captures second-order curvature of the loss. However, computing the full Hessian is intractable
for modern neural networks due to its size. Instead, we approximate curvature by estimating the
top-k eigenvalues of the Hessian at sampled points along the path. These dominant eigenvalues
represent the directions of largest curvature, and therefore serve as a proxy for the “sharpness”
of the loss landscape <a href="#ref_17">[17]</a>. Large top eigenvalues indicate steep, narrow regions (high sharpness),
while smaller values indicate broader, flatter basins. Practical estimation of top eigenvalues can
be achieved via iterative methods such as power iteration <a href="#ref_18">[18]</a>.

						<h3>4. Results & Analysis</h3>
            We present a detailed analysis of the loss landscape and connectivity 
			between minima for ResNet models of varying capacity on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. 
			We primarily focus on Bezier paths, as PolyChain paths exhibited similar trends. 
			Across all experiments, we examine how these metrics vary with model capacity.
			The greatest observed differences in results occurs between ResNet-8 and ResNet-26, 
			which correlates with the biggest relative jump in capacity, a ~4.5× increase in parameters.

			<br>Studying such linear paths is useful because it provides a simple baseline for understanding
			the geometry of the loss landscape: any drop in performance along this line indicates a barrier
			between the minima. It is important to note that the observed barrier height along a convex
			combination can be large simply because the path is linear, and not necessarily because the
			minima are inherently separated. Higher-order paths, presented in Section 4.2, may circumvent
			these high-loss regions and reveal more connected low-loss trajectories.<br><br>


			As can be seen in the plot below - across architectures - straight-line interpolation caused 
			similarly large accuracy drops.
			Effectively showing that increased model 
			complexity does not reduce barrier height along linear paths. However, larger 
			models showed a narrower low-accuracy region, indicating they occupy wider basins 
			of good performance, while smaller models traverse longer high-loss regions. Thus, 
			overparameterization affects the width but not the depth of the barrier on linear paths.
			This <strong>does not support</strong> the idea that deeper networks reduce barrier height, though it 
			remains possible that barrier height decreases along curved paths, which will be examined 
			next.

						<h2>4.2 Barrier Height</h2>
			The tables below shows that smaller networks experienced large dips in accuracy when 
			moving along the low-loss path, whereas larger networks were much more stable. 
			For example, ResNet-8 lost more than 7% test accuracy at its worst point, while 
			ResNet-65 and ResNet-119 dropped only ~2%. This indicates that deeper/wider 
			models are easier to connect smoothly: their loss basins are flatter and more 
			consistent. However, gains seemed to level off beyond ResNet-65, suggesting 
			that very large models may not benefit further in terms of barrier height.<br><br>

            Since the two norms ||A - C|| and ||B - C|| are close to each other, the low-loss path is roughly symmetric, 
			and therefore we can reliably use the interior angle ∠ACB as a proxy for the path's 
			degree of nonlinearity. Smaller angles correspond to a larger outward displacement of 
			C and therefore to a more strongly curved low-loss path.<br><br>

            On CIFAR-10, the angle decreased consistently with model size, from approximately 
			69° for ResNet-8 to approximately 55° for ResNet-119, indicating that larger models 
			relied on more strongly curved paths to maintain low loss. This <strong>goes against</strong> 
			our 
			original expectations that the curvature of the low-loss paths would have an inverse 
			correlation with model capacity. A similar, although less pronounced, trend was observed 
			on CIFAR-100.

			<br><br>
			As a supplemental note, while ||A − C|| and |B − C|| are useful to validate the assumption
that the low-loss path is symmetric, two reasons make it difficult to arrive at a conclusive 
statement for the trend of either metric alone across model capacity. Firstly, while there is an increase
in the norm from ResNet-8 to ResNet-26 on the CIFAR10 dataset, the differences amongst other
neighboring models with CIFAR10 are small, while the CIFAR100 dataset shows no clear trend.
Secondly, Euclidean distance in high-dimensional space can be misleading as the differences in
noisy dimensions can accumulate to dominate the distance between the relevant dimensions.
Practically, this makes it difficult to confidently identify a relationship between model capacity
and the distance between minima

						<h2>4.4 Sharpness</h2>
            The sharpness of the low-loss path provides insight into the robustness and 
			generalization capabilities of a trained model. Our analysis reveals that, 
			for the same optimizer hyperparameters, smaller models like ResNet-8 tend to 
			find solutions in sharper minima compared to larger models like ResNet-119 which 
			opt instead for flatter, wider basins. This <strong>supports</strong> our hypothesis.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
            <br>However, despite the low barrier height for a large model like ResNet-119, our 
			results show that the sharpness still changes by a factor of 2 between the 
			endpoints and the midpoint of the low-loss path. To ensure that this behavior 
			was a more global rather than local property, the average of the five largest 
			eigenvalues of the Hessian was studied, which supported the behavior exhibited 
			by the largest eigenvalue alone. The results can be seen below.

			</figure>
            <br>The sharpness behavior highlights that a low loss alone might not be enough to 
			classify a path as consisting of truly equivalent solutions. This can be relevant 
			in scenarios such as when the low-loss path is being used to create an ensemble of 
			neural networks. If truly similar performance is desired, it can be wise to also 
			consider the sharpness when creating such an ensemble, otherwise, the varying 
			sharpness can lead to unequal generalization capabilities amongst the ensemble.

						<h2>4.5 Loss Landscape </h2>
			
            Visualizations of the test error over a two-dimensional grid in the plane spanned 
			by the two trained solutions and the optimized midpoint revealed how error varies 
			not only along the low-loss path but also in its surrounding region. In all cases, 
			the straight-line interpolation passed through a pronounced high-error ridge, 
			while the optimized curve circumvented this region by bending into areas of 
			lower error.<br><br>

            Notably, the extent and shape of the low-error basins differed systematically 
			across architectures: ResNet-8 exhibited a relatively narrow and fragmented 
			low-error region, with steep transitions into high-error zones, whereas deeper 
			models such as ResNet-65 and ResNet-119 displayed substantially broader low-error 
			basins, within which the optimized path remained confined.<br><br>

            This suggests that larger networks form wider and more coherent regions of good 
			generalization performance, despite requiring a curved path to connect minima. 
			The transition from narrow to broad basins is visible in the progressive flattening 
			and widening of the low-error contours across models, indicating that 
			overparameterization produces landscapes in which low-error regions are not 
			only connected but also spatially expansive.

						<h2>4.6 Generalization Gap</h2>
            The difference between the train and test accuracies, referred to as the 
			generalization gap, can provide valuable insight into the quality of the 
			solution which goes beyond simply looking at its loss. As previously discussed 
			in sections 1 and 2, it is generally accepted that flatter minima 
			result in improved generalization capabilities. We hypothesized that 
			increased flatness (induced by increased model capacity) would align with 
			improved generalization capabilities. To test this hypothesis, 
			we studied the generalization gaps from the low-loss Bezier curves.
			
			However, the results from the CIFAR-10 dataset only <strong>mildly support</strong> our 
			hypothesis while the results for CIFAR-100 actually <strong>go against</strong> it. 
			We believe this inconsistency can be explained by the model capacities used 
			in our study.
			
			<!-- <img src="./images/gen_gap_v1.png" width=1024px/> -->
			<figure style="text-align: center;">

				<figcaption style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 6px; font-weight: normal;">
					Figure 5: Generalization gaps for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<br>
            As can be seen in the plot above, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, the generalization gap follows 
			the double descent 
			phenomenon, and the results in the plot below support our hypothesis that low sharpness 
			(induced by overparameterization) leads to improved generalization along 
			the entire length of the low-loss path. However, the evidence is only mildly 
			supportive. We believe the interpolation threshold occurs around 0.5M parameters,
			but most of our model capacities fall above this threshold.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, we do not have a fine range of data in the ”classical” regime showing the lead-up
			to the interpolation threshold, and we believe a model larger than ResNet-119 would better
			illustrate the behavior in the ”modern” interpolating regime. Therefore, to produce stronger
			support for our claims and better characterize the relationship between overparameterization,
			sharpness, and generalization, our future work with the CIFAR-10 dataset intends to study
			models with new sizes such as 0.01M, 0.3M, 0.5M, and 2M. 
			<br><br>

            For CIFAR-100, the results in the right-hand side of the plot below, do 
			not support our hypothesis that links overparameterization, 
			sharpness, and generalization. We believe this is because we have not yet reached 
			the interpolation threshold. This is supported by the right-hand side of the figure
			above which shows that while the training error decreases each time model capacity is increases, 
			the generalization gap only increases.
			We believe the interpolation threshold is near 1.2M parameters as that is the first time the training error 
			approaches 0%.<br><br>
			Due to the large computational requirements to
			train a ResNet-119 model, it was not within the scope of our timeline to train a larger model.
			Given additional time, optimization hyperparameters could be adjusted in an attempt to reach
			the interpolation threshold earlier. Alternatively, compute resources aside, models of larger sizes
			such as 2M and 5M could also provide valuable data. We believe these larger models would go
			above the interpolation threshold and generate support for our hypothesis.

						<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
            This project performed a systematic, quantitative geometric analysis of the loss landscape for
			ResNet architectures of varying depth, helping bridge the gap between theoretical properties of
			the optimization landscape and empirical model performance. Our findings support many core
			tenets of existing literature on mode connectivity, provide new information about the geometric
			properties of the connecting low-loss paths, and highlight novel, counter-intuitive insights that
			warrant further research.

						<h2>5.1 Key Findings</h2>

				Our analysis of the Bezier-optimized low-loss paths 
				revealed a clear evolution of the loss landscape 
				with increased network depth:

			<ul>
				<li><b>Mode Connectivity and Barrier Height:</b><br> We confirmed that 
					increased network depth reduces the barrier height along the 
					curved paths between distinct solutions. Test accuracy loss along 
					the path dropped from over 7% for the shallowest model (ResNet-8) to ~2% 
					for the deepest models, indicating that overparameterization creates 
					a smoother, more easily traversable loss manifold.
				</li>

				<br>
				<li><b>Sharpness and Robustness:</b><br> We verified the hypothesis 
					that deeper networks tend to converge to flatter minima, 
					which literature associates with improved generalization. 
					We demonstrated that sharpness is not uniform along the low-loss path, 
					varying by a factor of 2 even when the loss and barrier height remain minimal.
				</li>

				<br>
				<li><b>Path Curvature:</b><br> Contrary to our initial hypothesis, 
					the low-loss paths connecting minima in deeper networks were 
					found to be more strongly curved. This suggests that while 
					overparameterization creates broad, connected basins, the optimizer 
					must exploit higher-order non-linearities in parameter space to 
					navigate the lowest-loss routes between them.
				</li>
				<br>

				<li><b>Generalization Gap:</b><br>The inconsistency in the generalization 
					gap results between CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 suggests that decreased 
					sharpness alone is insufficient to guarantee improved generalization, 
					and that the benefits may only manifest past the interpolation threshold. 
					This requires further investigation with larger models.
					</li>

						<h2>5.2 Significance</h2>
            The primary significance of this work lies in its quantitative findings, 
			which move beyond the mere <em>existence</em> of low-loss paths to characterize their <em>geometry</em>.<br><br>
			
			<ol>
				<li> <b>Theoretical Advancement:</b><br> The observed variation in sharpness 
					along the path has profound implications for ensemble methods. 
					It shows that traversing the loss manifold yields solutions that are not 
					functionally equivalent in terms of robustness, necessitating that 
					ensemble generation strategies incorporate sharpness as a selection criterion, 
					not just low loss.
				</li>

				<br>
				<li><b>Principled Model Design:</b><br> By establishing a clear, 
					quantitative link between network depth and geometric metrics 
					(barrier height, sharpness), our results enable more principled model 
					design. Researchers can now anticipate the topological characteristics 
					of the loss landscape induced by architectural choices and make more 
					intelligent decisions on model architecture and optimizer selection.

						<h2>5.3 Future Work</h2>
            Given the fundamental nature of our findings and the computational constraints of this 
			study, several avenues for future research are warranted:<br><br>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Architectural Universality Testing:</b><br> It would be valuable to 
					apply these techniques to more complex and fundamentally different 
					architectures, such as Transformers. The primary objective is to investigate 
					if the observed geometric phenomena are universal properties of deep neural 
					networks or if they are tied to specific model types, and to explore if 
					modern complex architectures, where theory is harder to apply <a href="#ref_19">[19]</a>, 
					present new phenomena.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Efficiency of Path Discovery:</b><br>A deeper exploration 
					is needed into the conditions under which the low-loss path 
					transitions to being linear or near-linear. A computationally 
					powerful result would involve predicting the existence and geometry 
					of low-loss paths in complex architectures, similar to recent work 
					on predicting optimizer dynamics <a href="#ref_20">[20]</a>, which 
					could lead to novel insights into the loss landscape itself.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Scaling to the Interpolating Regime:</b><br> Future work should 
					extend the CIFAR-100 analysis into the "modern interpolating regime". 
					This is necessary to fully characterize the generalization gap inconsistency 
					and verify whether the benefits of increased capacity only manifest past 
					the interpolation threshold.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>  <b>Optimizer Influence on Path Geometry:</b><br> The counter-intuitive 
					observation of increasing path curvature warrants investigation into how 
					different optimizer regularization techniques and hyperparameter settings 
					might affect the non-linearity of the low-loss paths, aiming to identify 
					methods that promote straighter, lower-curvature trajectories.
