  <h2>Loss Landscape Exploration</h2>
  <p>
   <p>
  <strong>Authors:</strong> Joe Koszut, Theodoros Xenakis<br>
  <strong>Date:</strong> December 2025
</p>

<p>
  This project investigates the structure of the loss landscape between modes of deep learning models, with the goal of better understanding training dynamics and improving model robustness. The work was submitted as a semester project for <em>6.7960 – Deep Learning</em> at MIT and received a final grade of A.

  <h2>PDE Simulations</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik S. Grønlund, Magnus U. Rønneseth, Theodoros Xenakis<br>
</p>

<p>
  This project was developed as part of <em>TMA4212</em> at NTNU and received a final grade of A. It explores numerical methods for differential equations through two independent implementations.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Project&nbsp;1</strong> applies Finite Difference Methods to the SIR epidemiological model, implemented in <strong>Julia</strong> using Jupyter notebooks.  
  <strong>Project&nbsp;2</strong> studies Finite Element Methods in <strong>Python</strong>, with applications to the Poisson equation and an optimal control problem for temperature regulation in a rod.

  <h2>AIS Vessel Position Prediction</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Authors:</strong> Einar J. Rye, Henrik S. Grønlund, Theodoros Xenakis<br>
</p>

<p>
  This project was developed as part of <em>TDT4173 – Modern Machine Learning in Practice</em> at NTNU and received a final grade of A. The goal was to predict future vessel positions using large-scale AIS time-series data.
</p>

<p>
  The project centers around two standalone machine learning pipelines implemented in Python.  
  <strong>Pipeline&nbsp;1</strong> uses a Random Forest model, while  
  <strong>Pipeline&nbsp;2</strong> applies XGBoost.  
  Both notebooks independently handle preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, postprocessing, and prediction generation.
</p>

<p>
  Supporting work includes exploratory data analysis, time-series feature construction via shifted datasets, model comparison, and postprocessing to enforce physically plausible predictions.
